# runm

experimental vm adaptor for runc, run containers natively on macOS

## background

instead of creating containers directly on the host, we use a hypervisor to create a guest vm and run the container inside it.

the core functionality provided here is effectivly a modified version of the `cmd/containerd-shim-runc-v2` binary from the `containerd` project.

to work around the linux requirements of the shim, we proxy all linux dependencies to the guest vm where we run `runc` unmodified (hopfully).

## linux dependencies proxied to the guest vm

-   `mounts`
-   `oom`
-   `namespaces`
-   `seccomp`
-   `schedcore`
